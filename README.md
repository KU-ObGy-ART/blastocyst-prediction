# Repository Under Construction

This repository is currently under construction. We are preparing to release the associated code along with additional details on our research.

A preprint of our work will soon be published on medRxiv. The title of the manuscript is:

"Innovative AI models for clinical decision-making: predicting blastocyst formation and quality from time-lapse embryo images up to embryonic day 3"

Once the preprint is live, we will update this page with a link to the publication and further information. Thank you for your patience and interest!
