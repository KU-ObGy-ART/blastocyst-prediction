## Overview
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files that implement and test the model described in our preprint. By running the notebooks on Google Colab, you can easily reproduce our experiments and evaluate the model.

## Running on Google Colab
To run the model on Colab:
1. Open the desired `.ipynb` file from this repository using the [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/KU-ObGy-ART/blastocyst-prediction/blob/main/Blastocyst_Prediction.ipynb) button or by copying the URL into [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to install the necessary packages and set up the environment.
3. Execute the cells sequentially to run the experiments and view the results.
